# Password-Generator-
A passcode/password generator that will randomly select a variety of numerics, symbols, and letters with the capability of capitalization for it's user. I worked alongside some classmates, my instructor, and office hours to help get to a finished acceptable product. Added a lot of variable statements, if/for loops to help make the variables truthful and falsey. Was able tom implement the concat, split, join,isNaN, window.confirms/prompt elements to efficiently guide the user to success. All in all i feel as if my JS code is as DRY as possible and am pleased with the turnout.
